Problem Description: 

In this problem, you need to monitor bushfires using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The UAVs will
fly over an area of interest and collect data on temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other relevant
factors. The data collected by the UAVs needs to be processed to identify areas where there is a high
risk of bushfires and areas that need attention.
