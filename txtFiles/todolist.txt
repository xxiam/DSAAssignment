finished dijkstra search algorithm,

to do:
done - fix removeAt method in linkedList.py - done
done - add value in DSAGraph.py, using UAVdata.py - done

- fix dijkstra algorithm
    - work on the pathing list

- create scalability program - UNI
    - allow creation of new nodes and links - done
    - create interactive menu and test functionality - wip
    - allow deletion of nodes and links
    - create search method for finding nodes

- hash data - UNI/HOME
    - every time the uav traverses a location, hash data into table - done
    - compare and discuss efficiency of using hashtable instead of array
        

- heap ( i dont know what im doing )
    - i dont know yet

- itinerary 
    - implement DFS search algorithm
    - create most efficient uav flight path

writing and testing
    - yanno
