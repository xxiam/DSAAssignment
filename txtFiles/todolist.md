# tracking what to do and what I finished

## finished
- fix removeAt method in linkedList.py

- add value in DSAGraph.py, using UAVdata.py

- allow creation of new nodes and links

- every time the uav traverses a location, hash data into table

- compare and discuss efficiency of using hashtable instead of array

- fix BFS algorithm 

- heap

- create interactive menu and test functionality
        
- delete vertex issue

- create scalability program
## to do:

- itinerary 
    - implement DFS search algorithm
        - hamiltonian cycle
            - would A* work?
    - create most efficient uav flight path

## work in progress:

- report writing !!!

- DSAUav.py file
    - put all methods in and test functionality
    - user interactive DSAUav.py file

- used dijkstra's algorithm but still needs to fix some datatypes:
    - change from dictionaries to hashTables
